NVDA calls really just be an infinite money glitch right now. Time to buy MORE!

Congrats and keep up the level headedness.

Then blow it all so we can laugh at bigger numbers.

I say this with love. :)

At least celebrate the win with a couple of hookers first.

General sentiment on this sub is that cvna is gonna tank from what I've seen

23% short interest? And 20x up from highest short? No thanks
----------------
The problem is the father/son duo are cooking up the books so it‚Äôs just going to rise until the wheels fall off and when that happens it will be amazing.

Oh forgot to mention, I‚Äôm still holding 4x AAPL 6/28 215c‚Äôs üòÇ

It's that chance that you can lose it all that makes it so fun. Great job getting back up!!

You all are idiots for still using Robinhood.

You realize that $1500 worth of calls isn‚Äôt enough for these guy to care, right?

Stick to your plan‚Ä¶ come back with the results‚Ä¶

You tell us.

Peloton short it is, thank you for the hint.
----------------
Bet your entire life on this. No balls.
----------------
Peloton was a fad that didn‚Äôt fail sooner because the pandemic saved them. Covid is over and Rich house wives realized they can‚Äôt fuck their peloton like they can fuck their personal trainers. So they ditched the bike and are back to paying for dick.

I remember I was going to buy puts when PTON was 90 cause I knew the company was toast. I read an article by WSJ giving PTON a 100 price target so I didn't go in. They have since deleted the article. 

Fuck any and all price target articles.

PTON is going to 0.
----------------
Absolutely not. I've glanced at their balance shit and it gets horrid over time. The company has plenty of debt and the situation hasn't improved over the last 2 years. This is a bike company, in an era where more and people become obese and lazy. Like, I understand that you believe in a potential turnaround story, but **at the very least** wait until the next earnings report to actually see a development of a positive trend.
----------------
I thought the same but tbh I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll have enough of an impact. They also consistently pay out millions in law suits
----------------
Tobacco/nicotine companies are just one of those things. They‚Äôve always been around, they‚Äôll always be around, but no one is excited about the prospects of supporting said companies. Haha Even though like alcohol it‚Äôs something you can always bet on being marketable I have trouble picturing people diving in to buy stock for it. I smoked for 20+ years and even I have zero interest in ‚Äúowning a piece‚Äù of said companies. At most I‚Äôd bet a few contracts just for the fuck of it.
----------------
Tread carefully, beginning about two months ago there started being major supply issues with ZYN and had to start going with whatever flavor they had and a month ago I couldn‚Äôt find them at all at any of my local gas stations and switched to a different product which I‚Äôll probably end up sticking with because I kind of prefer them. Not sure if it was just my area affected but that doesn‚Äôt seem very likely.

Looks like they're getting their shit together, I'm in @ 7/5 130c

This is certainly a tempting play.

Hasn‚Äôt Ramaswamy been SNOWs CEO since February? What changed between then and now
----------------
Anytime an Indian is the CEO, I‚Äôm bullish. Nikesh Arora and Shantanu Narayen has made me money before, long SNOW calls, this might be the bottom. 

Also the last CEO reported that he was buying shares around this level.
----------------
Good one. I m in maybe

PLTR is the best AI play. Snow making their own LLM is waste of time. Snow is good cloud data lake Warehouse etc.. but AI not a chance. Snow trying to grow  inorganically in the AI space and they focus on sales.

You have puts on nvida and calls on affirm? Brother are you allergic to money? Just transition your balance to SPY shares and learn to read 8ks, 10ks/qs, and the Greeks.
----------------
I think my suggestion to you maybe to not pick single stocks as you said you go back to options?  So just buy $VFV.TO (Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Fund in Canadian Dollars) and forget about it?  Contribute to it regularly and focus on your job or a side hustle.

Buying puts on nvidia right now is the equivalent of lighting your money on fire.
----------------
Just move it to a Rrsp account at least you will save on income tax
----------------
Or‚Ä¶. Just give your money to me.

There is lesson to be learned. If u can see it then it was worth it
----------------
Put the money on VOO or SPY and take a break
----------------
You‚Äôre paper trading right? Never seen TaxFree savings. If you‚Äôre not, then I suggest you do as if you. They give you a lot of paper money but I‚Äôd stick to the amt of cash I would have to trade with. You lose a lot learning options before you‚Äôre successful.
----------------
Nvidia just did a 10-1 forward stock split and you bought calls? Bruh you are burning money. Affirm is a good shot though imo
----------------
‚ÄúLong term isn‚Äôt for me‚Äù you‚Äôd really rather have your money sit cash then sit in something like btc or solana, even fuck around with some meme coins if you like the gamble but it‚Äôs gonna yield you way better  if you just hold

God can you imagine how ugly a Tesla phone would be

I don¬¥t think, Musks mind is on phones. If we want to develop a theory, linking the dots of his recent endeavors, I¬¥d assume, he is trying to create the fundamentals to upload his mind. That¬¥s why he needs a brain/compuer interface, massive computing power and supporting AI. Satellites would be intended to create a network that won¬¥t break down, if one element is disrupted. One copy of himself, he¬¥d probably shoot to the stars (or Mars). Tesla would probably just be his way to pay for that.

Obviously this sounds like a crazy (or visionary) idea, but tell me, you don¬¥t believe, Musks has already thought about how he can cheat death.
----------------
So, invest in Tesla for something Starlink, Twitter and x.Ai are doing? Makes perfect sense, where do I sign up?
----------------
OP still has Elno's jizz dripping out of his ass.

Another Elon cuck fanboy ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226)

Tesla is down over 50% from ATH 32 months ago. Shits going to below 100$ as his near term goals continue to not be met and EV market feels much pain next couple years.

20 bagger actually. Go all in!

They got a monopoly of parking 1000 cars no one will buy in the parking lot of a dying malls.

Ask yourself... would you buy a phone made by Elon?

I hate Elon but this tinfoil theory is interesting ngl

Hey, bro, Elon doesn‚Äôt know you, it‚Äôs okay to not spin on it every once in a while‚Ä¶

I'm looking to build about a 1000 share position by the end of the year.¬†


It probably is conservatively 10x from here
----------------
Spy is +50% from Oct 22

QQQ is +75% from Oct 22

I don‚Äôt think investing is the problem your stock picks tho
----------------
-10% and you call it a scam? Wait until you are at -50%. Oh and try using real dollars
----------------
Canadian dollars? What are you, poor?
----------------
Fellow Cibc user
----------------
Bad idea... According to Swiss America simply using cash can have you branded as a criminal.
----------------
yeah dude. As a Canadian I literally own no Canadian stocks. I sold them all this year and then started making money. Originally I mostly owned Canadian stocks and they all fking sucked and lost a lot. Just don't invest into Canadian stocks they suck man
----------------
Just use the history of your contributions to your portfolio and model what you would get if you were just buying and holding SPY/QQQ - the simplest thing you can do and what absolutely everybody tells you to do.

Realize that the problem is not investing but your choice of stocks despite market index ETF investing just exists and probably because of some attempts to time the market and sell/buy at certain moments.

Cry. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Store it under your mattress for additional gains

I can feel that your next investment will skyrocket, guaranteed perchance
----------------
cash = Devesting
----------------
So your conclusion = invest in the only thing that is guaranteed to trend to zero over time üòÇüòÇüòÇ
----------------
How did you go from $150k to $700k in 2022?
----------------
No need to stop investing because of a small drop. Just diversify. Some bonds, some stocks, some ETFs, some options. If you are nervous then load up on more bonds than stocks easy as that. It's better to gain +5% than 0%.
----------------
Quit picking individual stocks! Besides, those aren't real dollars.
----------------
Get a HYSA or stop being stupid.
----------------
Bonds. 7-8% and the value increases as interest rates decline. Just diversify so you don't buy bankrupt companies. But bond holders get paid first even then...
----------------
id throw it all in Tesla and let it simmer for at least 2 yrs.
----------------
Start making some interest off that cash buddy.
----------------
Buy Intel dude 

Hold for the rest of the year 

I think by December you‚Äôll be at 1,250,000
----------------
Just DCA into VOO for 30 years, years it's down you get a discount and divis buy more shares, then when it's up closer to retirement switch it to Tbills.
----------------
In the states I can get 5.25% yearly interest paid monthly insured up to 250k. I don‚Äôt have all my
Money in cash but it‚Äôs not bad garneteeed returns right now.
----------------
Just buy NVDA calls. It's not that hard.
----------------
The flaw in this is as follows. Companies historically returned cash to investors in the form of dividends, which is reflected in the yield. However, in recent years, stock buybacks have become a more prominent method of returning cash to investors. Since yield does not reflect buybacks, this one metric can be misleading.
----------------
It has been a long time since investors cared about fundamentals. Nowadays investors only care about momentum; can I sell it for a higher price tomorrow then I bought it today.
----------------
This is what [Hussman Funds](https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/observations/ob240528/) thinks too. They are a well known bear but it‚Äôs difficult to fault their analysis that the risk of low returns over the next 12 years is high, even if nothing is guaranteed of course.
----------------
Earnings to price matters MUCH more than dividend yield.


There has been a secular shift from dividend payouts to share buybacks due to more favorable tax treatment and greater flexibility.


More to the point, dividend yield is irrelevant. It's dead as a predictor of return.
----------------
Dividend does not matter, the value is subtracted to the stock. For normal investors it's almost pointless.
----------------
Interesting that this matches going off the gold standard exactly.

Thanks for sharing. It will give me something to ponder
----------------
Boomers btfo
----------------
And was quite high during the 2009 recession???
----------------
Absolute boomer stock logic. 

Younger investors don't give a rat's ass about dividend and yields. They trade options. If price go up/down, if there is volatility, they make money. So many people in the sub are trading 0DTE/weeklies/monthlies on SPY, QQQ, etc index funds they make money short term.
----------------
It can go lower you want to test that theory? I‚Äôll buy in at open. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
----------------
Intel - the forever poster child of buy high and sell low.
----------------
Buying intel is like choosing to buy boeing when you have a chance to buy spaceX.
----------------
Another 20 year INTC bagholder is about to come into existence.¬†
----------------
This sounds like a challenge
----------------
Intel looks horrible, but in terms of their actual business, if They do Get demand for their newly announced server solutions &amp; accelerators, they might survive and would be sort of cheap in that scenario.
You can‚Äôt blame the market from being catius in beliving in a Intel turnaround at this point.
----------------
Open option interest makes me think it'll stay pinned right at $31 this week, then shoot up to ~$35 after 6/21. That's what I'm betting on anyways
----------------
&gt; Too big to fail

I'm 300 lbs and a complete failure
----------------
I've been building up a position in shares lately. Given how it tends to trade sideways for months at a time, not sure calls are worth the risk.
----------------
Maybe‚Ä¶ I saw that but didn‚Äôt see a good sign of a reversal
----------------
I like the TLDR at the end.
----------------
That‚Äôs some serious cope my guy
----------------
Has it really bottomed?  I mean, I'll gladly invest $100 in it if you want to see how low it will go.
----------------
Intel is a dying company, don't let rudimentary TA take you away from the fundamentals. This is a legacy business that cannot grow even with capital investments directly supported by the government. There are better opportunities out there.
----------------
Why would you think it‚Äôs going up this week? That put volume is crazy unless people just call it early. At this point though those puts below 30 are already basically worthless. I don‚Äôt think it moves significantly just looking at these numbers.
----------------
Isnt intc partnering w nvda and making nvda chips ?

A 30% price target that might take a year. Pass.

Unlike others NVDA MSFT AMZN hell even IBM stocks have risen IONQ is down like 50% last 6 months. I have a small position bc of shotgun approach to quantum but I see no immediate catalyst to change things. I will increase my position once/if stock starts performing hopefully your right.
----------------
I am doing my PhD research in quantum computing (devices in quantum computing specifically) along with my group, and we are very pessimistic with it in the near future. I have been to numerous conferences for quantum computing, and most talks on these conferences look into derivatives of research in quantum computing instead (e.g. transistors at sub-kelvin temperatures).

We believe it is extremely early, technology-wise, for quantum computing to be actually realizable. The same with AI back in the very early days, the theory was all nice and done, but it took a while before the technology was actually made.

So, while I agree with a lot of what you said here. I personally do not think quantum computing is going to be useful for a while.
----------------
Didn‚Äôt mention AI. Not sure I‚Äôm sold on it.
----------------
My thesis is extremely bearish on QC. I worked in a lab adjacent to quantum computing hardware at Yale and almost all the researchers were pessimistic. There‚Äôs just too many problems:

- The huge amounts of qubits needed for error correction, we are at best a decade away from anything functional from QC. IONQ uses trapped ions which easily decohere, and are difficult to initialize which fucks with scaling.

- Hardware R&amp;D companies like IONQ have much larger expenses then software startups, and does not have the luxury of being unprofitable for long periods to survive on hype.

- Frankly, very little amount of the problems people actually care about have an asymptotic computational advantage with QC. 

- Due to advancements in AI and classical computing, most problems are faster classically even if a quantum algorithm has asymptotic advantage. This difference will only increase as times goes since orders of magnitude more resources are being poured into AI versus QC right now.

- Stagnation in funding in recent years, both on the government and private fronts

- Post quantum encryption exists, so the idea that quantum computers can ‚Äúhack‚Äù anything is overhyped 

- QC stocks like D-wave and IONQ are plummeting without ever looking like they will reverse. At this rate they‚Äôll probably get delisted before the extremely, extremely unlikely case QC sees a breakthrough.

- As a physics major QC is pretty cool as a subject of study, but coolness doesn‚Äôt make $$$.

Frankly I cannot see a world where QC ever becomes viable.

Fuck Vanguard.  I have been having the hardest time transferring my remaining assets to RH.

They keep giving me the run around without any actual answers.  And, of course, I can't sell anything while they are "in process" and have lost like $500 because of them.  They literally transferred stuff out to RH, and then reversed it and took it back *after* I sold it in RH.

*Not financial advice.*  With ya on this one.  Going to drop my schizo "dd" here as well for anyone who's researching this company.  I'm curious to hear what others have gathered.

- 80% gross margins.  50% of revenue spent on marketing to further increase recurring revenue.  If they decided to switch off the marketing machine this company would suddenly be extremely profitable.

- Marketing is working.  [Search interest](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fg%2F11fkypmfp7,%2Fg%2F11c3krgywp&amp;hl=en) in the Hims brand has been steadily rising over the past 5 years, while interest in competing companies (Teladoc for example) have stagnated.

- Marketing is working really well.  +60% revenue increase yoy.

- Low debt to equity ratio. $105 mil in cash and equiv., $103 mil in total liabilities.  There's no risk on the balance sheet, they could pay off all their debts any time they want with cash and equiv.

- ~14% short float.  Not enormous, but significant.  Maybe shorts will keep doubling down and price will keep sliding up.

- Small $5 bill market cap.  Price could move a lot from just a handful of buyers.

- The CEO believes in his company.  [Andrew Dudum is a 10% owner](https://www.gurufocus.com/insider/177824/andrew-dudum) with a $264 million stake.  His recent sales have been tiny compared to his overall stake.

- Compared to other companies, the valuation of Hims is cheap.  The price to sales ratio on a lot of big high-growth tech companies (MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, etc.) is &gt;10.  Hims is only at ~5, so 2x in price isn't unreasonable.  Compared to another small $10 bil cap company (ELF) with similar sales of $1 bil, similar gross margin of 70%, higher debt-to-equity ratio, and IMO less stable revenue, Hims should be at least 2x current price today, even higher next year.

- Biggest downside risk I've read so far is "no moat".  [85% subscriber retention rate](https://www.emarketer.com/content/hims-hers-caps-off-forceful-2022-by-nearly-doubling-its-revenues) is the moat.  Moats are bs anyways imo, every new growth company could face competition from a larger competitor.  TSLA still ate the lunch of established auto manufacturers.  AMD still ate the lunch of the biggest chip fab in the country, INTC.

Love you too

I have January 2025 calls, and saw this today: 

[Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan drops coverage of weight loss drugs](https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/blue-cross-blue-shield-of-michigan-dropping-coverage-of-certain-weight-loss-drugs/)
----------------
Curious to know the uniqueness of the model. Why can other player not enter in this if they see the model succeeding ?

I spent 10 min answering 50+ questions and creating a profile for Depression / Anxiety medication and then I saw the potential $147 as a cost for 30 days of pills. I am not sure how comparable that this to visiting your healthcare provider. I mean their website and UI looks cool to cater to Gen Z but not if they have something reliable. 

All that to say there is surely strong momentum so why not cash in while the wind is blowing in the favor.
----------------
Sold my hood calls to go all in on some 11/24 30c.  Have a good feeling about this one. Or maybe that‚Äôs just the dick pills.
----------------
Imagine if they tapped into the adderall market
----------------
Hey u/tobeearnestthocomma,

Do you know how HIMS actually obtains their drugs, where are they sourcing them from. I have no clue where they actually make the most revenue and profit from so I would love to see a distribution of their revenue in a chart similar to this:

https://preview.redd.it/igw6jjeu9r6d1.jpeg?width=2047&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c9231de0c4c8567e68871baef3704496fbd6012
----------------
p/e is negative 1500. Stock recently doubled in past couple months. Its not the right time. This company is trading at a massive premium.
----------------
I‚Äôm curious to see if HIMS will make a push into the Testosterone market. It makes a ton of sense and has synergy with their other products. Online T doctors and pharmacies already exist but none with the name recognition of HIMS. They have to keep growing their product offering and this is the one that makes the most sense.
----------------
Aaaaand just realized my donkeybrain posted this rant without finishing the title. Oopsie poops.
----------------
BTC at 66 right now?  That's a downturn?  HAHAHAHAHAHAA

Talk to me when it drops below 40.
----------------
Because I bought some.  Sorry I‚Äôll sell so it‚Äôll go back up.
----------------
Downturn? Like anyone believes that. Any day it will randomly pump and then be right back there.
----------------
Buy this dip while you can
----------------
&gt;Bitcoin Halving: The Bitcoin halving, a significant event that typically leads to a price increase due to reduced supply, has already occurred. Historically, past halvings have been followed by substantial bull runs. Yet, this time, the market remains stagnant. 

See here please: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bl8mq8/bitcoin\_price\_data\_around\_halvings\_time\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bl8mq8/bitcoin_price_data_around_halvings_time_from/)
----------------
Because crypto is a ponzi scheme?
----------------
Got to shake people out.
----------------
Kinda answered your own question. What‚Äôs the next thing/catalyst to look forward to
----------------
Where is the bull run? It has to happen after the halving, everbody knows past results are 100% indicative of the future ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421)
----------------
I don't think the halving was as significant as people attributed it to be because it was successfully priced in this time.

But I'm happy to buy the dip.
----------------
This is great! if we get really low I can buy some micro strategy leaps.
----------------
You will wake up one day and say, "I sure wish I would have bought that dip at 65k."  And you will say it again and again until you sell your stash completely and don't look back.  Or lose your shirt completely and sleep under a bridge.  Understand the risk of your gamble and plan your profit schedule.  It is pretty simple stuff and I think you are asking the question because it is probably underperforming your near-term expectations.  I am pretty stoked about 6x gains in five years.  But I am pretty bummed on the recent fall from 72.  Crypto will harden you though.  Extreme volatility and massive 1% candles on the 1-min is just how it goes.  You want to really push it?  Hold 3x leveraged calls after a dip over the weekend.  Just gonna glance at the chart really quick.. brb.
----------------
Takes about a year for the halving to have any effect.  crypto being stagnant/stable is great for the sector.  I believe in Bitcoin long term as a store of value, so I DCA daily.  Not big into crypto in general but I like BTC, its a brilliant financial ledger system.
----------------
This is what always makes me hesitant to buy bitcoin. I never understand what makes it move.
----------------
The bull run historically takes close to a year to kick off after the halving‚Ä¶
----------------
But the sizzle, sell the news
----------------
Crypto did surge. It's up 35% since the bitcoin etfs came out and is fluctuating between 30-40% lately. The surge already happened
----------------
**Sell the news**
----------------
Liquidity in the spot markets is drying up. That means it becomes easier to move the price, which goes for both directions.

Right now we're testing how much it can move on low volume and whether there are people stepping up to defend either side.

I predict tough times for leveraged traders.
----------------
Op sounds like a real Dufu
----------------
Love these comments. Might be time to short this trash. Enjoy the bags, baggies.
----------------
This is best time to buy alts because it is going to rebound in due time. BTW, I'm buying more utk and aast here
----------------
Back to 30k with you..
----------------
It already ran up in anticipation of all that

Now people want to cash in
----------------
Simple: speculation needs to be fueled by catalysts. As catalysts wane, prices drop. Chasing after the dangling carrot gets tiresome. The carrot needs to keep getting bigger to keep people running. Eventually, doubling of size wont matter . The carrot needs to grow exponentially and faster. If not, üìâ
----------------
You took a screenshot... Sooo... Sell it
----------------
Sell and just buy a higher call with ur original investment
----------------
Sell half and let the other half ride.¬†
----------------
Better pull out before karma snatch everything
----------------
Everyone here telling you to sell....¬†
NVDA hitting 140 on 6/17 confirmed
----------------
Sell to cover initial investment. Let rest ride.
----------------
I'd hold I don't see the GPU shortage anytime soon
----------------
I always sell half at a double
----------------
I would‚Äôve sold it when it hit 50% return
----------------
Definitely hold it until expiration, don't be a pussy, scared money don't make money
----------------
8/16 expiry?

This is not much in the way of DD and definitely not advice, but bear in mind there is an annual meeting on 6/26 - likely will cause stonk to go up (because stonk only go up), and the next earnings call is 8/21‚Ä¶.

So keep those things in mind before you sell.

NVDA is a wild beast right now and does not show any signs of slowing down.

I‚Äôm highly regarded, so I‚Äôd hold. Or, like someone else said, maybe sell half and hold half.
----------------
That‚Äôs still otm, sell couple
----------------
Sell. Protect your profit. It could disappear in seconds.
----------------
Hold it until the PE is no longer positive, when the sales drop or when the sentiment turns
----------------
This week 17-21 is there convention so may go higher but you know the rules when you screenshot :/
----------------
slowly bleed out the profit, sell 7, then wait 2 days or whatever see how you feel sell like 5 or more etc... Keep in mind the golden rule "good enough to screen shot good enough to sell"
----------------
Until expiry date
----------------
Good enough to screenshot good enough to sell
----------------
At least all weekend for sure
----------------
I live by the saying ‚Äúif it‚Äôs good enough to screenshot, it‚Äôs good enough to sell‚Äù
----------------
If it‚Äôs good enough to screenshot, sell
----------------
Sell enough to cover your cost basis and some change and then let the rest ride. We‚Äôve got two separate catalysts this coming week and the week after. Assuming the leather jacket comes out it‚Äôs time to start piling in before the next spikes. This is to say nothing about $150 being absolutely feasible, even by EOM.
----------------
95% gains? I‚Äôd have already sold.
----------------
Until it expires
----------------
Yes bro hold for 200 with the rest of WSB I'm sure it will end up well.
----------------
Just bought some of those 140c for 9/20
----------------
You have 57 of them! I would‚Äôve sold half at least. Greed eats gains
----------------
160. Nvidia can reach 160 on a good run before correction. That's my plan
----------------
Hold
----------------
I‚Äôd sell it Monday morning immediately, or at least trim 50% and let the other half run
----------------
Also, if you don‚Äôt know if you should be selling now or not then I‚Äôd reconsider the amount you play with, you got $20k initial investment into it and aren‚Äôt sure if you should sell? Oooff
----------------
To the moon?
----------------
You‚Äôre supposed to buy more when winning
----------------
Too late. Should‚Äôve sold‚Ä¶
----------------
You can never go wrong taking some profit, even if partial, and tracking the rest to maturity.
----------------
Hold on to it until it's worthless, then post the loss porn.
----------------
I would have sold it by now
----------------
Hold it until it expires! no pussy
----------------
Tuesday next week should get you another 5-15k
----------------
Your not ITM so any pull back can wipe significant gains. I‚Äôd prob sell a third of the contracts at least.
----------------
Until it expires
----------------
I mean, securing that mush profit is enough to not have to trade for a year.

You could buy share in a company and sell OTM covered calls
----------------
Wait until you have 600% profit. Don‚Äôt sell until then. Remember: never take profit until it‚Äôs a 6 bagger.
----------------
I rather take the profit instead of pondering later on I should have taken the profit..
----------------
Sell 50% and take u r cost. Let it run another 50 and sell 25% and then buy put straddle covering the cost for 25% for 08/24.
----------------
Until 9/16
----------------
Close out position before July 22
----------------
17th of August sounds like a good date
----------------
I don‚Äôt understand why no one knows about selling to secure profits and rolling up, you‚Äôre up 21k and you wanna risk losing that? Lol just give the money away at that point
----------------
I mean his wiki doesn‚Äôt have the best track record‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt predict the 2008 crash, and seems to inverse himself a lot, so ATH March 2025 probably the takeaway. 

* His 2011 book goes on to suggest consumer spending will begin to plummet in 2012 with the Dow bottoming out somewhere between 3,000 and 5,600 in 2014. After hitting bottom, stocks will experience a mini-rally in 2015‚Äì2017 before falling into a final bottom during the 2019‚Äì2023 period, when the 45‚Äì50 age group troughs because the U.S. birth rate reached its own low in 1973.[6] The Dow Jones ultimately doubled in that timeframe.[1]

* In 2012 the "Dent Tactical Advantage ETF," symbol DENT, was de-listed having consistently under-performed the market for three years.[7]

* In 2013, Dent predicted the market would crash again in the Summer of 2013 and would take a further year and a half to recover.[8]

* In 2014, while promoting his book The Demographic Cliff in Australia, he predicted a major Australian housing market correction beginning in 2014 after an even bigger one in China.[9] He also predicted that the price of gold would fall to USD$700 an ounce, later revising this prediction to 2017.[10]

* On December 10, 2016, Dent predicted that the Dow Jones Industrial average could fall 17,000 points as a result of Donald Trump's election win. Less than two weeks later, Dent reversed his opinion and thinks there is short term growth for the US stock market, but demographic forces will keep the economic growth stagnant in the longer term.[11]
----------------
This is exactly what confuses the hell out of me with options‚Ä¶ so as I understand it:

This is 57 contracts, all for calls of $140 strike price on Nvida. 

Op is in the money and has made over $21k.

But the current Nvidia price is $131.25???
----------------
The guy is a kook. He says outrageous things to sell books. Ignore him.
----------------
The Batman villain?
----------------
I bought 6/21 140 calls on Wednesday at .15, sold around .40 and yesterday they topped out at .97. They‚Äôll ~20x if they go in the money. NVDA is a money cheat code right now.
----------------
Buy a liquor store and a brothel. Thank me later.
----------------
If you say bubble three times at midnight, it might just happen
----------------
This guy recently predicted stock valuations could drop to early/mid 90s levels sometime soon lol
----------------
I don‚Äôt understand these cries that we are on the decline, that the empire is collapsing.  We‚Äôre just getting started, and it‚Äôs going to be fucking disgusting.
----------------
Yeah cuz he‚Äôs a boomer and they all want the world to burn down once they‚Äôre gone. He sounds like another boomer nut job.
----------------
Show me his portfolio.¬†
----------------
I got a harry dent in my ballsack
----------------
Man they been predicting market crash for a while, they said that during Trump, it didn‚Äôt happen during a global pandemic, they said that during Biden, we are in 2024, it hasn‚Äôt happened. Nasdaq is at an all time high, S&amp;P is high. Despite 2 war going around and inflation it‚Äôs still hasn‚Äôt happened. Sometimes we need to stop and think all these ‚Äúexperts‚Äù been saying this for a while preventing people to invest due to fear, whom does it benefit?
----------------
Bruh, **stop listening to economists**. These people will get payed regardless of either they are right or wrong. These people do not put their money where their mouth is. Imagine regards here posting DD's without positions. I wish IRL there were was a demand from economists something similar to "positions or ban this f@\*got".
----------------
Harry Cock doesn‚Äôt know shit. AI is just starting get on the hype train muthafuckas!
----------------
Positions or ban
----------------
Dent is without a doubt the biggest fade in stock market history
----------------
Two face ain‚Äôt telling me what to do.  Tails bitches!

How about this bozo buys some finasteride and boosts my $HIMS position
----------------
Politics is always part of the discussion when it comes to markets.... Happy to have the discussion though.
----------------
I thought this was going to happen the day Obama was sworn in.
----------------
Anytime someone gives an exact date of when the crash will happen they‚Äôre wrong.
----------------
I don't think you realize who you're talking about. You might be thinking he's just some economist like any other. He's not. He's a charlatan permabear. Believing Dent when he says the market will collapse its like believing the Burger King commercial when it says the Whopper is the juiciest, tastiest burger there is.
----------------
Bullish
----------------
So if 2024 is 1925, then we have five more years of this *bubble*. Get rich as fuck in the short term and when the bubble burst, you won‚Äôt feel the effects.
----------------
This guy is such a clown and regard that it's absurd. Dumbest prediction ever. That's the problem with bears. Never even a realistic prediction. Yeah the market is really going to crash 70%? Does he not realize that if it even dips 5% how much FOMO dip buying there will be. These guys have no clue how much money is involved into this thing and it's NEVER going away. The market cannot fundamentally crash. It just can't. End of story.
----------------
Boomer Doomer network calling a crash?  Nah. When you see 5 for sales per block we are fucked
----------------
I trust him. He correctly predicted the last 16 out of 2 recessions
----------------
Good to see fellow new member who lost about the same amount of money. We have one more chance to YOLO at least

You bought gay people? I'm still trying to figure out options and y'all are already operating at a whole other level.

This is cool and all, but I'm excited for Monday when you lose it all and post loss porn so I can jerk off to it.

I didn't think it's legal to buy gay people. In the event that I am wrong, what kind of return are we looking at here?
----------------
Never go full homo, bro. You should cash in on gay. You should carry this with Pride. You need to be careful though. There is a reason the gays use pride as a term. It isn't because of being proud. It is about the lion pride. They will see the full heteros profiting off them and go full lion pride and devour your profits. Be careful bro.
----------------
Happy pride month.

Living in the Boise area, they are going full tilt on the new like $8 billion facility they are getting huge incentives for. And there are over 500 job postings in Boise right now. When it is lean they are eager to lay people off, so I'd say they are going gangbusters right now.
----------------
We need some position proof here.
----------------
I hate myself (again).

I was hovering MU 1-2 weeks ago when it was at 129$, and specifically looking for earnings play with 06/28 calls. Was looking at 140$ strike, but decided not to because I have reverse Midas touch. I think I would have tripled, and we're still a couple of weeks out of earnings!

Honestly though, at 140$ now it's starting to get dicey. A positive earnings might make it tick up, but not enough to cover the premium.

Then again, what do I know.
----------------
In with you bro 8/16 155C
Honestly with all the bullish signals coming since last month I cant see why they would fall. Worst case they stay flat after ER which is why I bought 2 months out
----------------
Micron started full scale production of the memory chips needed for NVDA Blackwell a quarter or two prior to competitors. The timing was good--Blackwell VASTLY increased the number and sophistication of memory chips per GPU (I think 16x but haven't double checked). 

They also appeared to reprice upward against NVDA when there was that earthquake-based supply disruption a few months back.

Hynix has been crushing it and they're still a bit behind MU. I'm very long on MU and will be adding on every dip until earnings.

Life savings on micron?
----------------
Been looking at them since dec. pissed I don‚Äôt pick up calls back in Jan or Feb.  LFG!! Jumping in
----------------
I think you‚Äôre confusing on chip SRAM, which has nothing to do with micron, and DRAM. Maybe dive a bit deeper.
----------------
Sell on news?
----------------
I was just looking at Micron as well!! Def going to do a call play as well!
----------------
Bro is dependent on an intern. What could go wrong? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
----------------
I like Micron for HBM and for SSDs, along with DRAM. All are seeing increased uptake with AI CAPEx.
----------------
Q3 is going to be bumper for MU. Average SSD ASP from Q2 to Q3 has gone up 100%. Petabytes sold has also gone up more than 15% Q on Q. They have an NVIDIA QA team in hour in Taichung for the HBM qual. 180 target for me

This is very thorough.  The price is looking like it's bottoming, too.

I like Cloudflare, it's easy to use and does its job, and is most importantly, free. That is also the main problem for the stock - there is no clear path to increased revenue growth. I don't even pay for the sites I host there, and honestly I don't want to. Nothing Cloudflare offers me in the paid tier is *that* useful for hobby projects, which is a majority of the users.
----------------
I love NET but that stock loves to fuck you in the ass..
----------------
Nice write up, thanks! I‚Äôve held NET for a long time. I‚Äôve toyed with swapping it out, based solely on competition in the space. This tips me back to holding further. I think they can grow, just not as much as I‚Äôd first believed. Also, I love their ERs! Those guys are so smart, funny and hopeful. Truly want to make the internet beautiful in a way. I think edge computing is the most promising aspect of the company and their global reach most reassuring.
----------------
Cloudflare isn't that useful in enterprise where you get similar offerings from traditional cloud vendors
----------------
You had me at Silicon Valley. Calls on Jin Yang.
----------------
I think their storage solution is mostly a byproduct of what Cloudflare uses for its CDN, it‚Äôll probably be a niche player, I‚Äôm really impressed with Azure Blob/Table storage, and pleasantly surprised when I get to work with it instead of S3, and would guess if s3 loses any market share it would be to azure instead of cloudflare. 

What I really like are Cloudflare workers, I think it‚Äôs the next logical step for Cloudflare, and I like the pricing model being based on compute cycles. I hope they catch on, I‚Äôm building most of all my web projects with it, depending on how they build out their analytics platform, I think a logical business model could be analytics similar to datadog. Right now if dd is down businesses are flying blind, with cloudflare handling networking, id put a lot of trust in a monitoring solution provided by cloudflare.

They are facing controversies also

My opinion: the only thing that could make the stock go lower than 160 is the grounding of some type (maybe 787) but I think that is very unlikely. Everything else will keep it above 160 because it is more or less priced in. Long term they should be good I think (doesn‚Äôt mean its a buy though). Order books are full for quite some time and the US gov will do the rest.
----------------
They have a government protected market share. The only thing that‚Äôs going to be crashing are their planes
----------------
If they can kill with little to no recourse that‚Äôs a sign of strength.  America always has Boeings back.

They're plans sure are

The company is an important part of the united states military industrial complex, being fed trillions, and orders for all sorts of shit that nobody asked for or can even use are being placed all the time. So no, it's not going anywhere.

This font looks like your homework or something

This font is the modern day equivalent of the shoe shiner story

This font looks like a kids homework that's hanging up on the fridge
----------------
Looks like OP is crayon eater.  But those are gains, not sure he belongs here.
----------------
Okay wtf
----------------
354% ROI
----------------
Only maniacs set their font to Comic Sans, and somehow that seems about right for WSB.
----------------
I showed this font to my gay friend, and he said, "Damn, that's just gay."
----------------
Disney ahhh font
----------------
It's like he didn't eat his crayons and actually used them to write his brokerage statement

Please take this as a sign to change that font

Google of a decade ago would have, but these days google is too concerned with chasing pennies on youtube ads than advancing civilization

I was wondering what drugs you were off or on when you said this, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm off my adderall and getting pretty bored so I‚Äôm gonna wrap this up.‚Äú

And then you kept rambling for another few paragraphs‚Ä¶
----------------
Fewer rules in place over a chabot doesn't make it something other than a potentially more dangerous chatbot.

I'm not reading all that unless you can guarantee me $100,000

Interesting takes! Thanks.

Time to double down and do all or nothing.
----------------
No one ever went broke taking gains. I see a point where you could‚Äôve been happy.

Thank you for the porn.
----------------
Finally, a post we can enjoy. All those gains people post are so boring.
----------------
Lmfao you a silly silly gooner
----------------
Was probably very exciting though. Hope you had $30k worth of fun. Go ahead and take profits next time. Fair warning‚Ä¶you will likely exit your next play at 25% profit only for it to run to 300%. Trading is fun like that.
----------------
How hard is it to buy nvda calls
----------------
TSLA?
----------------
Learn to take profit lol
----------------
Same happened to me, except i lost 3k
----------------
It‚Äôs not a loss if you never realized gain.
----------------
Wild loss bro. But remember money isn't everything in life and as long as you don't have debts you'll be fine
----------------
What you were holding my mate! $BB? Ouch
----------------
Boy you had a great up shoot before the ride lol
----------------
Yea...options will do that to ya.
----------------
Money is not everything, but no money is depressing
----------------
No more options
----------------
But it's up 20k though...
----------------
That‚Äôs pussy shit go check out my post
----------------
Man, wish I had 30k to blow on the market. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôd probably lose it just as easily as you did‚Ä¶.but I can only dream
----------------
Don‚Äôt know, just keep buying NVDA
----------------
When Cathie Wood buys at the top in 2035
----------------
It will probably go down when I surrender to FOMO and buy again (sold two months ago)
----------------
Corporate espionage, natural disaster, ww3, or quantum computing are some of the few real threats to NVDA. 

Nobody will be able to catch up to NVDA.
----------------
Leather jackets only do 2 things...go up and get cooler.
----------------
Is it worth buying now?
----------------
I think AMD will prove it‚Äôs a competitor. Give it time. It‚Äôll grow.
----------------
Nobody can stop clan Jensen, of house Huang.
----------------
Unless someone figures out something better than gpus with a toolkit that makes it easier to use. Nvidia got lucky when engineers realized you could use them to train heavy parallel processes like mathematics.  Nvidia was happy with video game drivers. So who out there will get just as lucky to stumble into this arena?
----------------
If Nvidia has been working on AI chips for 5 years and it takes 5 more years for another company to produce a functional chip that puts Nvidia 10 years ahead.¬†


I don't know how long Nvidia been working on their AI chips but you get the point.
----------------
Tesla was same two years back. Everyday it used to 1-2% up and then bubble burst and now close to its real value. Lots of money to be made both ways if you  bets short term. NVDA will become stagnant and some other ticker would come. PLTR maybe
----------------
&gt;Nvidia makes so much from them is they are able to massively overcharge because nobody else knows how to make them or can make them. YET.

Same idiotic statement as every other person who brings this up. Just say you don't know a fucking thing about chip manufacturing. Hint: You'll know who it's gonna be because they're going to announce a $10b+ to do it in.
----------------
AMd's on it, they're hiring talent left and right
----------------
Thanos
----------------
You will. Go all in on it!
----------------
When competition catches up.
----------------
It's going to be people right here that lie their job and need money.¬†


Then everyone will start selling, put buying, algo craziness and boom. Back to 2.7T by fall.
----------------
Considering NVDA is #3/118 in the VWUAX fund it better not have anything happen to it. Just saying, for a friend. üòè
----------------
BNED/IMMR is my vote!!!!!
----------------
the big guys (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN‚Ä¶) when they decide to scale back capex because of lackluster demand and overall lousy IRR
----------------
Man... They're so far ahead.

They're already working on next generation chips when their competition hasn't even invented the wheel.
----------------
This is already happening with amd.
----------------
*trump voice* CHINA!
----------------
Think when they become the world's largest company and/or get added to the DOW.

That's my exit.
----------------
God couldn‚Äôt stop this train
----------------
You really think NVDA is the only player?

You deserve to lose all your money
----------------
Reality.
----------------
TSLA, and Elon has already done it, just waiting for the best time to announce to the world on X.

I bought DM over like 2 years as it lost 90% of its value.

Sold for like 30k loss, but put whatever piddly bit was left into 121 NVDA calls last week and basically im neutral now.

  
fuck DM
----------------
Been investing like a madman in Rolls Royce üöÄüöÄüöÄü¶çü¶ç
----------------
Half my portfolio is INTC and BA. Every gain I've made this year has been almost exactly offset by their current share price and DCA at new lows.

My next big play is AMD and SBUX if you want to know what the worst performing stocks for the second half the year are.
----------------
Nothing has pushed my shit in more than Rivian‚Ä¶

I got assigned COIN shares at 155 and thought it was a miracle when I got out of them at 180.

Now I'm thinking about spinning back to it at current prices.
----------------
LULU big fan of the brand and stores are packed. Like the balance sheet too and think the selling is overdone.
----------------
SMCI cost me $10k a couple months ago but the volatility + AI connection just makes it such an attractive play. Also, the loss was my fault, not the stock's, as is always the case; if I play it right, I'll make money, if I don't then I won't and it's my fault regardless of what the traded issue is.

Anybody else still playing with it?
----------------
INTC is in bad position, I had it, and then sold it after it has been moving sideways. i heard they were going to try to retool, but the cash reserves they have is not enough to cover it, so they are going to have to be saddled with some debt Which will drag on revenue during the change over.
----------------
Dell. Got in around $145
----------------
HRTS ETF.  It has a portfolio of companies with or which are developing weight loss/diabetes meds.  It‚Äôs up but underperforming S&amp;P.  I thought selling weight loss to Americans would print money but I guess AI is even better.
----------------
I bought DM a couple years ago and SLI. Lost my ass on both. Riding the RYCEY train though from when it was about 1.25 so that makes up for it.
----------------
IBM for me, lost 15% but now it's looking juicy again.

Psny, polestar planning on building cars in the US made it an easier buy, they have good access to sell cars in both the US and China but electric vehicles have a rocky future, I still think their current new low they hit today of .60 is under valued considering their backing and ability to turn out products.  I bought at .75, looking for $3.50 to exit, it‚Äôs an extremely cheap gamble
----------------
LUNR. Fuck that guy who said it's going to the moon. It's dropped like a rock. But it looks like it is near the bottom, I can't imagine it going any lower

I own Intel as well. Could be another 2 years before a turnaround is realized by the public. Could be tomorrow. Just own shares and we'll do well.

"Nur Deutsch" has been killing their workforce singlehandedly all these years and it continues to do so. Needs a generational shift to the language superiority complex to mellow down in their job market. So many German companies don't even embrace English in tech jobs üòÇ

Puts on spy is like betting against America üòì

How did anyone lose money this week ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
----------------
Holding over the weekend is dumb
----------------
lol imagine betting against America a few weeks before July 4th, in an election year, when inflation is cooling and we're on the verge of rate cuts. Good job regard hold till 0
----------------
Imagine betting against the USA on Flag Day.
----------------
OP I know you felt like this is coming back, but let me teach you something, when your option value has decimated over 70% you actually need like 140% back to even make some money. It was a better idea to let your dough settle and get a new position. Your long weekend will turn into a 5 days terror. Now you know.
----------------
The longest week of your life so far. Try value investing instead. You're Nostradumbass. If this fell into your lap it was always luck. You're not going to come out ahead always placing it in luck's hands. The machine will eat you alive and throw the scraps to the wolves. There are too many moving pieces and variables here and you aren't an insider with a scoop.

Nah.  You'll get used to weekends like this.  I haven't had one in quite a while but I am sure one is coming soon!  

Decent play.  Not saying I agree with it but it's decent.

On the bright side you have **Gold Perks**

The longest weekend of your life so far.

Dumb. You deserve this.

I don‚Äôt understand how people fall this far down the bear hole after getting raped by bulls non stop. If you‚Äôre down 15% get the fuck out you ain‚Äôt catching no top.

Enjoy the weekend. Because Monday is going to fuck you raw
----------------
The longest weekend of your life so far

FWIW I made a big 0DTE on July 5 (I looked back 6 years and SPY was green every day after the 4th) expect last year

That‚Äôs it?

Look at the bright side, you didn't lose money in the after hours.
----------------
I closed those and went full regard mode with 537 Puts for 6/18 hopefully out P prints or I‚Äôm broke‚Ä¶

I Picked up a 3DTE put before close and then noticed a clearly defined descending triangle on VIX. Whoops

NVDA Bears. Wondering where your puts will open on Monday?

Think about how down bad they were Friday. It‚Äôll be even worse than.

# AI Discussion Summary
- A few people are discussing regrets about missing out on profitable trades in the past, either by selling too early or not buying. These conversations seem to be lighthearted and filled with self-deprecating humor, but there is also a sense of learning from past mistakes. 

- Someone mentioned having a dream about losing a significant amount of money by shorting the NASDAQ, which sparked a discussion about stock market predictions and potential risks. 

- A group is discussing the ethics and repercussions of buying stocks in companies that might not be ethical or sustainable in the long term, such as Intel. There seems to be a range of opinions, from those who believe in investing solely based on fundamentals to others who prioritize short-term gains through options trading. 

- Several individuals are very bullish on NVIDIA (NVDA), with some joking about it being an "infinite money glitch." Their enthusiasm is contagious, and many people are either holding or considering buying NVDA calls.
----------------
Had a dream that I lost $1 million shorting the NASDAQ. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
----------------
How big is the AI bubble in regards to SPY price? Can we expect a 20% correction or what lol
----------------
For anyone doubting AI.

Look at the job openings for AMD, MU, NVDA. Over 800 job for MU, 400+ for AMD, NVDA 800+ . Demand seems pretty strong for them to have all these job-openings. There really is no bear case.
----------------
Why is NVDA red? Have the good times stopped rolling?


Open the damned casino, I hate weekends. Everywhere is full.¬†
----------------
Meta has forced every big tech company towards insane capex investments towards AI compute. I think these capex investments will stay strong for the rest of the year and then level off after 2024. 

Other than Nvidia, who will benefit from the rest of this capex investment?

My June 21st 30.5 calls that are down 24% would agree with your edit ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
----------------
Dude if mother fcking warren buffet told me to buy intc because its gonna moon id pass, intel is the shittiest stock in the world.
----------------
They will be rebalanced out of the Dow and my Puts will reach Valhalla.
----------------
My reasoning for going into Intel was: the company can't just fuck up forever, so buy some now while they're down. Not a play for crazy gains over night, but maybe some long-term value..
----------------
I have 5,000 shares 
I agree 
Over the next 6 months I think we will see it
Back to 40 and after that another 25% increase year over year for a few years 

They are doing all the right things and it will pay off nicely if you want a steady climb and can handle the noise until next earnings
----------------
This is like a high schooler level DD, I rate this DD  ‚ÄúINTC/10‚Äù
----------------
This entire analysis is laughably wrong.
----------------
You really put 1.6m into Intel when you could‚Äôve bought the semi ETF and multiplied your money?
----------------
They need more government $$
----------------
The time to buy is after they actually start delivering on foundries. As long as they're still buying line time from TSM, there's no reason to even think about Intel.
----------------
Post a pic of your positions
----------------
I see Intel, I avoid¬†
----------------
You really think intel would see a resurgence? I could see that happening if they focused on data centers instead of computers.
----------------
Intel is donkey shit.
Once you realuze this, put money into TSM. It is half a decade or more ahead of Intel's dung heap.
----------------
I work in the industry. Intel is dog shit in many regards. I‚Äôd still work for them, but their stock is going nowhere.
----------------
I just dropped another 15k in NVDA.  I'm sorry gang, this is when it tanks.
----------------
We've hit the singularity. NVDA will consume the entire market.
----------------
This was the shit I was concerned about. If it's gonna double again to 6T that liquidity has to get sucked out of they rest of the equity market in a big way.


We're getting close to the point where the market goes down not *in spite* of NVDA's rise, but as a direct result of NVDA going up.
----------------
I sold calls on nvda and it just keeps fucking going‚Ä¶ when the fuck can i stop rolling my calls‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs stupid‚Ä¶
----------------
This has literally not dropped because I didn't buy shares or calls, if you guys want it to drop, lemme know I'll buy in.

I bought puts on Avgo I‚Äôm about to quit lmao
----------------
I just exited NVDA today. Love the company and stock. I was even arguing it was actually cheaper than AMD from a forward multiple perspective last month. So what if stock triples since earnings is also tripling.

I rode it to the post split run-up and bump. But now, forward PE has crept up to 50x. Maybe it can run to 55‚Ä¶ 60x but man, that is a lot of future growth they need to grow into.

Lot of hate on TSMC but I shifted there today. If money moves out of NVDA, I suspect it will somewhat land on AI supply chain. Plus, TSMC forward PE is only 28x and they release revenue for April and May that are well above Q2 expectations. I suspect they have some pricing power too.

I know, I know‚Ä¶ China! But guess what happens to NVDA or even Apple if China attacked Taiwan. So same risk there too.
----------------
What app or website do you use to get this view?
----------------
I'm kicking myself because I literally hovered over AVGO all of yesterday and two days ago. The calls were just too damn expensive and I couldn't find a good entrance price in case it dipped.
----------------
Signs of a top.
----------------
Lol. Lemmings On lube
----------------
NVDA is selling the chips, but can anyone speak to the usage of these chips and if those customers are seeing ROI on the chips? Or is the whole market rising on promises?
----------------
People keep saying it‚Äôs the top and wait for a dip but the dip never comes. So people missed out on a 15 dollar move this week hahaha regards
----------------
The entire market is sleeping on Google for real.
----------------
I did this with $40k in my Roth and now it‚Äôs worth over $100k. Now I‚Äôm kicking myself for not moving my 401k money into a 401k I could have managed myself. I would totally have taken the same risk.
----------------
I bought at $100 and sold at $400, felt like a brilliant investor.
----------------
I just transferred $15,000 into my Schwab account after seeing this post, going down a NVDA rabbit hole for 20 minutes, and deciding to rip it.

Lost 6.5k 2 weeks ago, I feel that

What happened?

This happened to me 3 weeks ago. So far i‚Äôve been able to recover $2k from the $5k I lost.

Completely new regard here. Can someone explain to me wtf i'm looking at in OPs picture.
----------------
Lol you‚Äôre gonna be rich. I have September 145Cs

Well that‚Äôs it boys I‚Äôm cashing out

I've got $100,000 just burning a hole in my pocket. Let's do this!

A 20% correction is going to wreck your position

Well done taking your profits üëè

Questrade gives me the best fills. Love to see others here using it.
----------------
Their financials look borderline suspicious to me. They've reported the exact same revenue for the past 7 quarter reports. It never moves up or down from $750m-800m revenue.

Meanwhile income always SLIGHTLY negative. 

Company looks like the walking dead
----------------
Bought at 700, happy it‚Äôs only 66% down? You r regarded
----------------
Put the volume next to it and you‚Äôll know why. When things bounce, sometimes they break the floor.
----------------
Quick glance I thought this was Robinhood. Haha Thinking 227 holy shit I‚Äôm a millionaire it was 22 earlier today! If only.
----------------
What do you think ? Worth the calls now?
----------------
Wait 1 year for btc crash and then buy the dip
----------------
Fine. I'll do it. I'll GRIND the bear!
----------------
Not gay enough
----------------
GRND is a hold-type stock not just a short term up and dump, has a lot of long term potential
----------------
In for 20 contracts
----------------
Come back When it's 420.69% gain
----------------
Looks like a $694 gain to me.
----------------
Where's the loss? You made $694
----------------
Nope. Bain Capital Ventures is on the board for Docusign. [https://www.docusign.com/company/leadership](https://www.docusign.com/company/leadership), Enrique Salem represents Bain. When venture companies are on the board, they can put said company's jobs on their site.
----------------
This will be DocuSign‚Äôs reckoning!
----------------
They have been trying to all year but couldn‚Äôt agree on a price.
----------------
the real question is how the FUCK does docusign justify having 7000 employees
----------------
Nice find OP.

Lost a decent chunk early this year due to the lowball offer from Bain and Docu's refusal. Bought a single $58 call expiring June 28th just in case.

If NVDA is 2nd by EOD then yeah
----------------
NVIDIA finished as 3rd ü•â today at the closing. Will this still trigger the rebalancing. I am assuming so. They might sell google shares and buy nvda for the weighting..
----------------
Kinda unfair for Nvidia to bypass Apple today. The company has a decent run recent 4 years. Apple has been around for ages. Logically, it supplies for all the big tech so it should be 1st market cap just a matter of time. Give it a month to run up.
----------------
If Nvidia corrects, the S&amp;P is gonna correct with it...
----------------
In 2023, NVDA climbed from May to August with no signs of slowing down
----------------
By correction do you mean back to $1000?
----------------
Yeah, the stock split 10:1 just so it can go to $20/share
----------------
Why not transfer in kind and not sell the shares ?
----------------
No.  

It's different this time.  

From here on out Nvidia will have a max draw down of 0.5% 

It's worth at least 50,000 Trillion dollars.  Minimum.

Once we hit 5,000 trillion market cap the company will be renamed to Unicron and have special symbol with same charaters UNICRON.  Also a new exchange will be created specifically for it.  The exchange will be called TRON.  Then I expect it to quickly 10x to my target from there.  

The day UNICRON starts trading on the Tron exchange it will open with market cap of 5000 T like I said and close end of the first week at 50000 T without one single down tick. 

Watch

Alternative exchange or ticker symbols will be BORG
----------------
It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre out for two weeks.

Enjoy the break
----------------
I been waiting for. A while : (
----------------
Yeah, sure, it's right around the corner just like it has been for the last 2 years, so don't forget to place your puts. (Sarcasm)
----------------
Nope....stocks only go up.
----------------
No
----------------
History repeats itself, but I'm not sure I'd count on a correction
----------------
You can transfer shares dont sell are you dumb?
----------------
Repeat with me.  Nothing will cause nvidia to correct except for a bad earnings or guidance. Maybe a taiwan invasion too.

Other than that.... nothing will stop this train. No big corrections.  Stop trying to time it.  Don't short it. Scalp every pump.
----------------
Stay away from this bubble, it won't end well.
----------------
Is there any known reason for the drop in stock price over the last 6 months? Struggling to find anything except for uncertainty and lower natural gas prices.

Currently long NFE shares
----------------
28% of the float is short with this catalyst playing out. Wild.
----------------
&gt;I love you more than üåàüß∏‚Äôs love Grindr

Now that's love!
----------------
Genuinely curious if you would have posted if you lost.
----------------
Now you should put those gains into GRND calls
----------------
If you‚Äôre trading based on random people‚Äôs suggestions i would quit while you‚Äôre ahead. But then again, I‚Äôm also a random so why should you listen to me? XD

No idea how to post 2 images on here. Here's the adobe trade.
----------------
I hit max gains on my adobe spreads. I like spreads for earnings because I don‚Äôt have to figure out when to sell. Way less upside though

Good job regard!

Yeah mf, sell and buy back. Congrats and fuck you!
----------------
I sold my ACN calls today, I will buy back next week if it drops otherwise I‚Äôll sit out

Got paper handed with the 1250s and sold for a loss

1100s keep me from Wendy's unless I'm buying something....

Had previously posted this as tesla bc I'm stupid and was daydreaming about Elon

Don't forget to take your profits üòé

Let me get this straight - you bought shares in Paypal but got puts on nVidia?
----------------
Literally just buy calls. It's not that hard people.¬†
----------------
Lord have mercy. What exactly goes on in the mind of a gay bear?
----------------
Just stop. Nvidia is not going to miss earnings, so nobody is selling their NVDA stock. Pick another company to short.
----------------
Why did you think the number was going to go down? Because it has been going up?
----------------
You‚Äôre literally throwing 25k in a fucking slot machine, where the game has a sign saying ‚ÄòWE DO THE GO UP ALOT‚Äô with PROOF

WHY

WHY NOT JUST BUY THE SHARES, AND WAIT A WHILE
----------------
"I was sad so I bought more"

This is the hopeless content we desire.
----------------
Man you are dumb.
----------------
funny part of this is that if NVDA dumped to 120 immediately, you'd feel like a fucking god and you would still end up losing it all due to overconfidence lmao

same outcome either way
----------------
‚ÄúThat I‚Äôve had since November of 2023‚Äù if your talking about that as if it‚Äôs a long time to not blow up I‚Äôm worried. Makes me think this isn‚Äôt the first blown up account lol
----------------
Your ride it up, then you ride it down. To early for the ride down.

The New World isn‚Äôt for you anyway

JFC.  You belong here.

Right next to the rest of us.

Who the fuck buys 0dte puts on a stock that's currently dangling the latest shiny thing in front of investors?

You belong here dude..

You doubled down on losing money? You're in the right place

Well‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶ you bought 0DTEs, what?

Bro.. all things AI start with NVDA.. should be called NI (Nvda intelligence) why go against the leader of the next Industrial Revolution. Do you short RK too?
----------------
And what did we learn today
----------------
Wow I can‚Äôt believe NVDA puts and more NVDA puts didn‚Äôt work when NVDA goes up almost every day
----------------
Maybe sell puts instead of buying them..
----------------
Go farther OTM and hit the SELL button next time...
----------------
LMAO
----------------
Wtf why?
----------------
Never bet against Queen Nividia.
----------------
Nvda puts. Stop reading
----------------
Someone's gotta pay for my premium, thanks.
----------------
Ouch! you're going to make it back on the next 0dte move...stay up!
----------------
I bought 127.5 puts this morning 0dte. Spy puts too, I was sure some sort of end of the week sell off would happen but NOPE
----------------
I don't know why anyone would short NVDA unless maybe they are hoping to catch a small drop on a down day.  Whether AI is a bubble or not, NVDA will sell about a billion more chips until we find out or until somebody finally catches up to them.
----------------
Write the puts dont buy them unless for stop gap insurance. Wait till monday, buyers remorse when you see what could've been.    i didn't buy either, should've.
----------------
Oh hey I sold these lol
----------------
Simulate my returns‚Ä¶ ‚Äúif it drops 1% then I‚Äôll be in great shape. I‚Äôll let this one play out.‚Äù
----------------
Hi fellow bear. I did the exact same thing today, had a couple of hundred dollars left today and threw it into nvda puts of all things, seeking revenge. We're fucking regards
----------------
If you catch it at the right time then it is doable.

You‚Äôre legitimately so fucking stupid. It‚Äôs been climbing the stairway to heaven the past week and you buy puts? You deserve to have lost it all
----------------
On Wednesday, I sold 200 puts for 6/14/24 $128.50 at $1.15 each. Net gain of over $22k
----------------
What moron buys puts on NVDA
----------------
Imagine buying puts on the single highest momentum stock on the market right now.
----------------
Revenge trading will get you every time
----------------
Look, if you are going to blow a car worth of money by shorting, at least do it on the index. At least your chances are sporting there.
----------------
UPDATE: Broke even on the second set of calls, net 15k loss. Didnt blow up my account but lost a good chunk. Not putting that much risk ever again. Lesson: Dont be a gay bear
----------------
I was telling my friend what companies are in the SP and I did a double take on ADBE like, WHAT THE FUCK 14%!?

Congrats man, nice work
----------------
Buying into HITI, just posted a net profit and fcf, legitimately good numbers for the industry but the whole sector is beat down
----------------
Do these companies even warrant retail investors time and money? NY, MA, CT, NJ are littered with black market shops and street dealers dominating any state run dispensary that you can find. I wonder if the same goes in other states, I know its the same but worse on the west coast. Makes me think, will weed stocks ever be worth it.
----------------
It‚Äôs really tough to regulate something like weed. It‚Äôs grows easy, like a weed. Good luck putting regulations on it and forcing people to pay a 30% premium.
----------------
If you‚Äôre willing to buy and hold for an indefinite period of time, I think now is a nice entry point. Expect to hold for a while, especially if the republicans secure the White House or a congressional majority. Laws and regulations are trending in weeds favor and I don‚Äôt buy into the idea that the unregulated market will cap growth on legitimate business. A massive segment of marijuana users are willing to buy from dispensaries but are unwilling to find a dealer. You‚Äôve got a lot of institutional money in these stocks, they view it as a viable long term investment and so do I
----------------
Usually when things get this bearish in weed its a good sign. Literally everyone is bearish right now its really bad, which is good. Source: been in weed since December 2015.

I think right now people just don‚Äôt care about weed stocks. I‚Äôm hoping that changes when schedule three happens but that would be good news (which is bad) so idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
----------------
TLRY, for example, had $627M in revenue and lost $0.44/share (about $370M) in the last 4 quarters. Revenue growth about 20% yoy, but no path to profitability in near future. Will have to do further offerings to raise more capital.

CGC is even worse, with negative revenue growth and equally bad profit margins

Only one that looks investment grade is IIPR. Profitable, although revenue growth only in single digits, and pays a dividend.
----------------
The deadline for ‚Äúcomments‚Äù on the proposed marijuana rescheduling is 7/22. The rescheduling will probably happen one or two months after that.
----------------
I think we might see a beverage company eventually get involved in cannabis but until then it‚Äôs not worth the gamble
----------------
Its time to get sober

I have a few weed stocks still - originally made 100k when Canada legalized. I keep a couple just in case news comes and it pops. I think it's only a matter of time (for a quick play, that is).
Don't trust me. Just a fellow regard
----------------
Go buy them on your own and get rekt on your own, cheers.
----------------
Hop in, but set stop-losses tight, volatility is high in weed stocks!
----------------
Yeah I held out hope and got killed by IV crush on my $MSOX.

Feelsbadman.jpg
----------------
Because it‚Äôs weed, was a great business because it was illegal but as everyone is learning, it‚Äôs now a commodity with too much supply.
----------------
The novelty of legalization has worn off and weed products have gotten cheap because of how much production there is now
----------------
I understand there are higher strains, testing, and research purposes but for weed in particular you can just grow your own. 

Maybe I'm just naive but I haven't seen someone make their own cigs or make their own beer (cheaply). Just my surface-level, WSB analysis. At least when you think "weed stocks! hell yeah, everyone smokes! ones gotta go huge!"
----------------
Decent margins are only possible with regulatory capture. It's weed.. that grows like..¬†
----------------
Probably because they aren‚Äôt very profitable.
----------------
TLRY is my pick-
----------------
Its not a good sector in terms of actual business outcomes, would never invest long term, but the US weed sector is highly reactive to news and def a huge swing trade oppurtunity
----------------
They are beat up because only stupid potheads actually think selling weed is a good business venture.
----------------
Shaking weak hands  theres no money for everyone
----------------
Weed stocks are penny stocks
----------------
We are approaching cannabis reschedule from 1 to 3. Once that happens large farms can pump product and price will crash. It will be a commodity business with some people caring about specialty. I have big doubts in the sectors future
----------------
All the legit brands seem to have terrible products curaleaf stuff used to be the worst.  I don‚Äôt use anymore but does someone have inside knowledge on who makes the most prestine stuff?
----------------
It‚Äôs cost of entry problem. What‚Äôs stopping a competitor from opening up a shop tomorrow with a catchy name and drawing their market share? What is any of these companies competitive advantage? If new states legalize and they are first in line for permits, sure - growth. The problem is that anyone can sell weed and it‚Äôs a disposable income expense in a tight economy.
----------------
Been in and out of these since 2015. Made good money mostly with dumb luck on the timing of some massive runs. But the few things I held onto thinking ‚Äúlong term‚Äù are some of the worst purchases I ever made.

I like weed. Like, a lot. But they‚Äôre not good stocks. The entire industry is a race to the bottom on pricing with an end game of Philip Morris or whoever swooping in and buying the still functioning businesses when they‚Äôre done beating the shit out of each other. It‚Äôs an amazing plant but ultimately it‚Äôs just an agricultural product and the way the stocks trade shows that.
----------------
Black market is wayyy too stable and established imo. Think about any company in any sector and now think if you could get their product easier cheaper and better on the black market with little to no risk. This is why I have stayed away from it all. And take in to account it will probably be legal in most states and probably federally in the near future makes bad news for weed companies imo.
----------------
Do yourself a favour and don't. But if you're truely deadset on gambling your money away you're better off buying jimmy or the movie company. Risk is equivalent, but the chance of upward movement is grater on the aforementioned.
----------------
Market saturation.. the end.
----------------
Yes go all in!
----------------
Over saturated market.  People can only smoke so much weed.
----------------
Baked in
----------------
You‚Äôre better off buying PM

It's a shitty, unprofitable industry for everyone except the corrupt insiders.

You know markets have been averaging like 10%? Maybe stick to indexes from now?

I've lost about $10k over the last 2-3 years, blowing up my trading account in the process, and I feel like an incompetent useless idiot. 

Don't know how you can stand to lose this much unless this is chump change for you

Just DCA into index and delete reddit

It‚Äôs only $66k you‚Äôre fine

I took a break for two years back in 2021. Was 95% down.  Learned a few things over that two year break. Came back in December 2023.  It is all about gambling money I can afford to lose, no emotions, ITM or very close ITM CALLs or PUTs. I will fuck a Bull, a Bear, your mother, whatever it takes.

 I ride the hype up and down and make money. I hate stock. I love money.  As of today I even YTD and only 70% down All time.  I am getting it all back, whether I make a $5 gain, $100 gain, or like today $3,000 gain.  Go enjoy your time off and your life. Good luck on your next adventure.
----------------
Don‚Äôt stop
----------------
Put 5k in AAPL next quarter and it‚Äôll spit out 100k
----------------
Imagine putting that money into Nvidia. Better yet, since you like options tradit, Nvidia options. But take my advice, just buy Nvidia at this point. It still has at least 2 years of run remaining. Good luck!
----------------
If I've learned one thing from personal experience and seeing all these graphs from people with massive losses, if you open an options position and it's immediately making money, sell it. See those little peaks. That's when you should sell. The regard move (which I've done too) is that you think "wow it's immediately making money, surely that means that it will make even more in a few hours or in a couple of days". If you open an options position and it goes red, it might actually end up making money.

Why not buy less contracts closer to the or in the money? Get a higher delta and pay less in commissions, am I right? I‚Äôm relatively new to options so I‚Äôm genuinely curious what your reasoning was, unless this was out of pure regardation.

If you‚Äôre planning to short then yes. Long term. CVS is dying. Just like rite aid.
----------------
I'm more bear-ish on CVS and dont think there is much upside.  Its currently trading right around where it was pre-COVID.  COVID was a boom for CVS as they were essentially getting free money from the government to administer COVID tests and shots.  Other things to consider:  
1) While USA population is aging, CVS owns Aetna so as more of the population needs health care services, Aetna has to pay out more  
2) The retail pharmacy area is being disrupted by the likes of Mark Cuban and Amazon.  CVS has made adjustments to their pricing but in the long term I don't think they will be able to compete, given the companies cost structure and size (slow to react)  
3) They are closing/optimizing stores that are a drag on their profits, but I don't think they are going to expand their footprint into the Midwest  
4) M&amp;A is lacking.  Nothing has really panned out from their Oak Street Health acquisition (that I have seen) and they actually started looking for PE backing to help fuel growth.  Which shows 1) the endeavor was much more complicated and costly the originally thought and 2) the leadership team doesn't know how to scale
----------------
CVS is really poorly
Managed at the district and regional levels 
I think it‚Äôs a multi bagger
----------------
Position?
----------------
Former Aetna owner here this stock has been hot garbage since the merger still holding, hope you‚Äôre correct.
----------------
My fear with CVS - as a shareholder myself - is that like all brick and mortar they are in structural decline. When I look at Amazon getting into healthcare on a 5yr+ time horizon, what excites me about CVS? 

A brand known for its stellar focus on customer service vs an in-person pharmacy? 

Yes, CVS is more than just a pharmacy, but what's the growth story that enables multiple expansion?
----------------
#TRAP
----------------
Great analysis! CVS's omnichannel strategy is indeed a game-changer.

Holding, i will wait till
Double or nothing

Was in my port for a while, bought in at 70's, it ran up to 90's, its back down to low 60's. Not currently holding any.



After the big recent drop from the mid70's to 50's, I think they will be announcing something big soon to bring the stock back up. 

  
I plan to get back in very soon. They're a slow roll / buildup, not a quick run up.
----------------
I‚Äôve been buying shares, but as a long-term investment not a short-term trade cause I don‚Äôt see a catalyst to move this up soon.
----------------
Very nice. Hope you get some tasty tendies with that.
----------------
Think October calls might be the play here if you are bullish. Gives you the opportunity to play their next earnings call and potential inclusion in the S&amp;P in September
----------------
Balls in on calls
----------------
Leaps. They have many catalysts coming. Also they have a curly haired CEO with government connections soooo
----------------
Long for sure, next big thing
----------------
Holding shares only and selling short term covered calls.  I think the company has substance but the revenue needs to increase.  I got burned huge on options when it tanked so I stopped playing that game.
----------------
Long long dca every month. Not regarded enough to gamble on options like most people here
----------------
Anytime it drops down to like 15 or so I buy more shares.
----------------
I like the company but they have a ways to go to grow into their valuation.  I hold shares and sell covered calls against them, then use the proceeds to purchase more shares.
----------------
Been long since ipo, cost basis 9. Long term play, not looking to sell for several years
----------------
Are they still diluting the fk out of their stock? That was one of my biggest gripes with them before. I still think they‚Äôre long term an incredible company, I‚Äôve just been burned so many times on bullish or neutral positions for years.

Side note, did a presentation on their platform for hospitals in my MBA course. Their product is legitimate fucking magic.
----------------
I am in long
----------------
Not

Been long since ipo, cost basis 9. Long term play, not looking to sell for several years

I got out when I finally broke even after 3 years. Never buying back in.
----------------
Anyone actually know what they do lol?
----------------
Aren‚Äôt like 90% of the recent analyst targets either holds or sells with targets between like 10 - 20? I don‚Äôt blindly follow analysts but I mean they must know something right

Are you any of you aware of the thousands of lawsuits currently filed against AI companies for "scrubbing" the internet of all data, audio, and video without a single acknowledgment of the content creator, intellectual property, or royalty payment? When one of these lawsuits is successful, and it will be, the entire AI as we know it will have to crumble and morph into something new. At that point this bubble bursts. Yes, AI is a different type of technology, but it is entirely based on stolen intellectual property.
----------------
Remindme! 3 years
----------------
the thing is all these companies MSFT APPL and so on invest bn in their AI but the return of these investments are not seen yet.
----------------
what we have now is a fancy trick with some scary tactics thrown in by musk for good measure. Ain't no cyberdyne comin for millennia
----------------
Uhhhh, ok.
----------------
&gt;You don‚Äôt name your AI product ‚Äúcopilot‚Äù if you plan on it taking over the world in 5 years.


Google has rebranded their AI tools like 15 times in the past year.¬† You think Microsoft is attached to the Copilot brand that's less than a year old??¬†


You belong here.¬†
----------------
sorry buddy, but u gotta be stupid to not believe AI will advance to an astronomical level within the next 10 years.
----------------
You're right. You wouldn't call a product "co-pilot" if you plan on it taking over the world.  You'd call it "Dominion"
----------------
It's not A.I. It's A.C...

'Artificial Capability'
----------------
I think we are likely at the start of a bubble but who knows how or if it will continue.  Im a software dev and l am constantly hearing people on the business side asking how we use AI for this or that.   The answer is usually that we can‚Äôt or wouldn‚Äôt want to or simply don‚Äôt need to.  

Right now im not too worried but if we start to see dozens of unprofitable AI start ups with massive valuations, that will be cause for concern.
----------------
I'm old. So I remember, in the early 90s they called the PC  "the Pet Rock of the 90s" &amp; "no one will need that". 



AI will be like nothing we have ever seen before. What you are currently witnessing is in its infancy, it will evolve into something we will utilize daily. It will be incorporated into most industries.
----------------
The thing with AI is that out of the 10s of thousands of projects, probably 1 or 2 will end up being the real next step in computing. Just from this fact alone, we are in a bubble that will pop the moment one player pulls ahead into the true AI future.

The thing is, no matter who wins, they will need a lot of computing power that is very modular. And NVDA is simply the best offer for exactly that. The proverbial shovel of the AI gold rush. The only way for the position to resorb at this point would be a 2nd equally dedicated GPU seller in the AI rush rising in competition, but I don't think it's possible at this scale in the short term.
----------------
A man walks into a business and says if you pay me a subscription I'll cut your overhead by 25%. That is AI. Who gives a shit how smart they are. There is a fucking massive market and it's not a bubble. NVDA MSFT and GOOG are about to become unimaginably valuable. 

I went to school for computer science and got my masters. I've trained 8 different small AI's for different hobby projects. I have one that trades micro futures for fun (it does, ok\~). 

one important thing to remember is that legislation can change everything. Right now the US is very Wild West about AI, but in the future legislation will have to be made defining its uses. The prices will flatten eventually but its really not a bubble. It's the Model T but in every sector.
----------------
TLDR:  OP doesn‚Äôt understand AI, is classified with the rest of the population in the fact it‚Äôll take 4 to 6 years to understand then, what we already know now!

If you‚Äôre not holding tech stocks when AI is understand by the normies then you‚Äôll
miss the holy grail of the tech stock super cycle!
----------------
Where there's honey there's bears
----------------
Why are you yelling?
----------------
Consumers will never see or utilize high functioning AI products. There is value. It‚Äôs just not at the consumer level. My guess is capability on the consumer end is capped currently. Copilot, ChatGPT all of them must be overly biased to spitting out boiler plate responses. Basically a search engine. Universities and startup are building their own models and they perform. But you won‚Äôt see them or have access without loads of cash. Months of research I found the machines exist and are proprietary. Some bleeding edge Financial firms have them but they aren‚Äôt for trading. They predict global trends industry leaders can play off. It‚Äôs an interview process just to talk with these firms. if it works why would I sell it and I definitely wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone about it?
----------------
What‚Äôs next my man, I rode this one with you!

Do you actually have an approach or reasoning behind playing these earnings that makes you believe it will go up or is it really just pure gambling?

Could someone help me understand? I'm still new to options and learning. So he put in $105k for the premium and the value of the contract is currently at $325k. How could one go locking in that $220k unrealized profit? Exercising the option would cost $2.3 million!

I simple man. I see Eugene post, I follow along. Also loved the part about CPI üòÇ as I missed HPE, CRM, but went in on puts with you. Taking a light position for now.
----------------
Def following, post all positions?
----------------
VRT and ClS have really been taking a shit after DELL ER and the revelation that the margins are small. ¬†Rip my calls
----------------
Alright you convinced me I‚Äôm in
----------------
holding some sep calls on VRT, do you think it‚Äôll again beat earnings next time ?
----------------
september 22c secured.   
  
do you have a potential bear case for HPE? do you think an NVDA correction will leak into HPE as well?
----------------
Poor boi in for the ride, 50 shares and 10 6/21c22

Is that how I write options idk what I'm doing probably shouldn't be here where is my free box of crayons.
----------------
Do you think there will be some sell-off before it goes up similar to what happened with AAPL this week?
----------------
I‚Äôm an expert in the data center space. Liquid cooling/immersion cooling have been around for years but are incredibly slow to adopt. I wouldn‚Äôt hold your breath on liquid cooling being rapidly implemented anytime soon. Almost all enterprise DCs are still using traditional cooling. Also, there is way more money to be made on the power side of data center sales than the cooling side.
----------------
So what is good to buy?VRT calls expiring end June? If yes - what strike is optimal?
----------------
Been in with August 22c for a few days now. Really like this into the event next week and beyond. Probably will look at more calls if this ends up being a sell the news event.
----------------
AHHHHH MY GOOD BUD EUGENE. I already bought hpe before this was posted and now that I see it I feel even better. I haven‚Äôt lost with you 2-0 hoping to make it 3-0 but I bought before this posted so will it even count? ü§î
----------------
The first one hit, let‚Äôs go again
----------------
I've been swing trading HPE since 2018. It's going to trade essentially sideways until the heat death of the universe.
----------------
What's a 3-4 weeks out strike price?
----------------
Yep I definitely need HPE to save me after apple bent me over this last run up.
----------------
I'm in for two calls expiring next Friday! Let's hope next week the event goes well. I think your reasoning is solid for the future of HPE. The cooling is a really interesting field for them to get into
----------------
Bought some $21.5 call for next week. LFG!
----------------
Saw how on the unusual call option vol this week
----------------
I went with jul $23c and june28 22.5c in case of pop next week. Think my strikes are a lil too far OTM but oh well we‚Äôll see.
----------------
I got in yesterday with 6/21 $21c and a $30 leap for 2026 let's do this shit
----------------
Hey Eugene, really a big fan of your DDs and insight. I was on the sidelines licking some wounds for your other plays, but am now in on HPE for some options and shares. Does it concern you at all that HPE is a dividend stock and does not traditionally have these big 20-40% swings? I am always wary when it comes to options plays and dividend stocks, and I wanted to know your take. Most dividend stocks I know of grind sideways, as they are not as focused on growing share price.
----------------
i missed VRT. thx
----------------
Intersting.

XLK has been one of my best holdings for the last 3 years. It‚Äôs def software heavy though and should have more NVDA exposure.
----------------
Someone posted about this earlier this week 

*IF* NVDA closes in the top 2 today (between NVDA, AAPL, and MSFT) then the balance will happen next Friday. 

So we could potentially see an 11bn slip between NVDA and either AAPL or MSFT next Friday

----------------
What date is the finally tally for it? Today or June 22
----------------
Looks like AAPL needs to be near 211 today and NVDA around 133 to solidify this today. Doesn't look like its gonna surpass AAPL but mighty close

*SoClose*
----------------
I'm smooth brained. Explain like I eat crayons
----------------
This post about to mislead lots of regards
----------------
XLK is the best
----------------
They're not going to let it happen for nvda.
----------------
What calls to buy ?
----------------
From what I recollect from my delta one trading days, there is a cap on the max percentage any single stock can take. Anything above 22 pc is distributed to other lower ranked companies. 

What‚Äôs more important is adtv - or how much days worth of volume would that rebalance indicate. If it‚Äôs above 6 days or so then many tracking funds either do block trades or start buying it before the event date.
----------------
What happens if it surpasses it next Friday?
----------------
Did Nvidia surpass Apple today?
----------------
Tight.

Wells Fargo: "We don't tolerate unethical behavior."

These stories always make me laugh. You‚Äôre basically admitting that your workers are getting paid to do bullshit if the only way you can figure out they‚Äôre not working is by using ‚Äúmouse jigglers‚Äù. Like presumably if they had actual responsibilities you‚Äôd just fire them because they‚Äôre not delivering their work. Makes it seem like Wells Fargo has a bunch of employees that don‚Äôt do shit.
----------------
&gt; "Wells Fargo holds employees to the highest standards and does not tolerate unethical behavior," a company spokesperson said in a statement."

Had to double check I wasn‚Äôt reading The Onion on that one.

"we fired a dozen employees not due to any substantive performance issues or complaints, but because they're fake key jigglers"

Glad to see WF so tough on the issues that really matter
----------------
Wells Fargo is a joke. Most unethical bank ever and they have the nerve to do this
----------------
Banks lecturing on ethics is, uh, something.
----------------
When I worked for a Wells Fargo call center many years ago I would constantly reset myself in the queue so that when people called in I was never the one that they were directed to. I just drank the office coffee, sat at my desk, and read books all day long. Good times.
----------------
Wells Fargo pays out 0.01% in their most common savings account in a 4\~5% environment.  They can afford to pay a couple of phantom workers.
----------------
You can get fired for that?!?!  


![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)
----------------
‚ÄúYou have met every job expectation and have been performing to a satisfactory level.  However we are going to fire you because you were using a mouse juggler instead of manually moving your mouse to pretend like you‚Äôre working like everyone else here‚Äù

Seriously, EVERY person in my office sits on their phone for half the day. Are we going to act like that‚Äôs any different than staying green on teams bc of a jiggle?
----------------
No need to plug in a USB device or run a downloaded program that IT can scan for. Most corporate IT security policies allow VB Script execution because Excel macros are so common. 

Save and run the following as a ".vbs" file. Name it whatever you like. It will show up in Task Manager as "wscript.exe", regardless, just like any other Macro or VB Script.

    Dim WshShell
    Set WshShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
    Do While True
    	WshShell.SendKeys("+")
    	WScript.Sleep(50000 * Rnd())
    Loop

Personally, I don't use it to play hooky from work. I'm legit working just not always touching the controls often enough to stay ahead of the screen timeout. This is particularly annoying because the docking station that work provides tends to not recognize my monitor setup when the screen wakes up and I have to power cycle the monitors to get them to be recognized again. Far less rage-inducing to just keep the screen active all day with the script.
----------------
Wells just mad their employees beat them at their own game, for them to claim anything about ethics is laughable.
----------------
Best thing my company gave me was a metal paper weight. It's been sitting on my ctrl key every day at work for the last 8 years lol
----------------
I am on the side of those employees. The company should not be monitoring employee's activity. If the employees aren't working, then the company is the one responsible for over hiring and overwork time. Do not hire so many people and lower the hours to 32 per week.

But using technology to look over employees shoulder all the time is just awful, and I don't want that future for America.
----------------
